    question: "How did you find my contact information?",

  {
    question: "Why is your questionnaire so long?",
    answer:
      "When we were building our questionnaire we held 7 focus groups made up of LGBTQ+ leaders and community members. These questions were brought up as needed to feel comfortable while entering into new care. Many of the questions are geared towards showing users (not providers) answers to questions they have even if they might be obvious for providers. After collecting all of the questions from our focus groups, we condensed nearly half of the survey questions to what we deemed as critical.",
