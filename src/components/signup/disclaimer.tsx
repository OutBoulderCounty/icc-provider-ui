                        It is paramount that you answer honestly and
                        transparently. We ask providers about their competence
                        with different communities and realize that not every
                        provider has expertise across all identities. You are
                        not required to have expertise across all LGBTQ
                        identities in order to be listed in this directory.

                        to provide safe and affirming care to the LGBTQ
                        communities. <strong>Please note</strong> that being
                        willing to provide care does not mean that you’re able
                        to provide the competent care needed. It’s advised you
                        have completed training with reputable providers.
